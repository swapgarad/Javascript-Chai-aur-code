// Traditional method of coding string:(its old method which rarely used nowadays.)

const name = "swapnil"
const repoCount = "01"

// console.log(name + repoCount + " value"); ====>>> its traditional outdated method not used currently....instead of that we use "STRING INTERPOLATION METHOD"...it create placeholders & we can directly inject variable as per our requirement in ${ }.

console.log(`Hello my name is ${name} and my repocount is ${repoCount}`);

// it gives output as ===>>> Hello my name is swapnil and my repocount is 01
